# HTML elements showcase

A showcase for (almost) all available HTML elements based on [MDN's HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

Use it to see

- what HTML elements exist, and what they are for, or
- the effects of your stylesheets on the HTML elements, or
- whatever you like :)

## About

“HTML elements showcase” is a tool to create a display of the HTML elements with descriptions and curated examples.
It takes the list of elements – categories, order, and descriptions – from [MDN's HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and renders them to a new page without any styling applied.
Selected elements are enriched with usage examples provided by this repository.
Primarily the elements that have intrinsic styling and are not deprecated are covered with examples.

As a result, if we want to see how a stylesheet affects the HTML elements, we can apply it to the produced page, and see the results.

- View it at the [GitHub page](https://benj9000.github.io/html-elements-showcase/).
- Download it as a [GitHub release](https://github.com/benj9000/html-elements-showcase/releases).

### Why?

I was playing around with very general CSS rules, and wanted to see the effects on all HTML elements.
There are a few snippets and test pages on the internet, but they have never seemed complete.
Finally, I decided to take a reliable source for a list of the available elements, and create a showcase myself.
